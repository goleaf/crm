# Krayin Contact Person

Source: [Krayin User Documentation - Contacts > Person](https://docs.krayincrm.com/2.x/contact/contacts.html#person)

## Overview
- Person records capture individuals (customers, leads, prospects, or other relationships) under Contacts.
- Access path: `Contacts >> Persons >> Create Person`.
- Records can be linked to organizations and reused when creating leads.

## Create person (UI flow)
1. Open the Krayin admin panel and go to `Contacts >> Persons >> Create Person`.
2. Add the person details:
   - Name
   - Emails (choose type: Work or Home)
   - Contact Numbers (choose type: Work or Home)
   - Job Title
   - Sales Owner
   - Organization
3. Click **Save as Person** to create the record; it appears in the Persons data grid.

## Manage person records
- Use the **Actions** tab on the grid to edit or delete a person.
- Filters available on the Persons grid: **ID, Name, Emails, Contact Numbers, Organization Name**.
- Persons and Organizations can be assigned when creating leads.

## Use in this project
- Mirror this field set and filter coverage when we build or refine our Person resource so Krayin parity is clear.
- Keep email/phone type selectors (Work/Home) and organization linkage in our UI to match the referenced flow.
