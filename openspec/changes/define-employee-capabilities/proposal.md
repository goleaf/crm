# Proposal: define-employee-capabilities

## Change ID
- `define-employee-capabilities`

## Summary
- Capture SuiteCRM Employee module requirements spanning the employee directory, core employee records, and HR operations so the CRM mirrors the requested capabilities.
- Detail how directories expose contact and reporting data, how records store employment/portal details and emergency info, and how HR artifacts (skills, performance, documents, payroll hooks, time-off) are tracked.

## Capabilities
- `employee-directory`: Directory listings with search/filter, departmental grouping, and reporting hierarchy visibility that link into employee profiles.
- `employee-records`: Core employee profile data including contact details, department and job role, employment status and start date, reporting manager, emergency contacts, portal access, and documents.
- `employee-operations`: HR-related tracking for skills and certifications, performance reviews/goals, payroll integration touchpoints, and time-off balances and requests.

## Notes
- OpenSpec CLI automation is unavailable here; requirements are documented manually for later validation.
