# Proposal: define-contact-management

## Change ID
- `define-contact-management`

## Summary
- Define contact management across individuals, organizations, and customers so the CRM can store rich profiles, relationships, activities, and segmentation data in one cohesive model.
- Capture requirements for contact records (roles/titles, relationships, activity history, notes, custom fields/tags), organization records (hierarchies, multi-contact linking, notes, custom fields, activity), and customer views (history, lifecycle, value metrics, segmentation).
- Align the data and UX expectations so contact, account, and customer-facing teams can work from consistent timelines and metrics.

## Capabilities
- `people-contacts-database`: Manage individual contact records with roles, relationships, activity history, notes, custom fields, and tags.
- `organization-management`: Track company/organization records with hierarchies, multiple contacts, custom fields, activity tracking, and notes.
- `customer-management`: Provide customer profiles, history, segmentation, lifecycle tracking, and customer value metrics.

## Notes
- `openspec` CLI tooling is unavailable here; specifications are drafted manually.
