# Tasks

- [x] Translate the Quote Builder bullet list into explicit capabilities spanning authoring, pricing, delivery, acceptance, and conversion.
- [x] Write `quote-builder` specs with ADDED requirements and scenarios for creation, line items/products, taxes, discounts, templates/PDF, email sending, accept/reject, versioning, conversion to order, terms, and expiration.
- [x] Capture design notes covering how acceptance links, email delivery, PDF/templates, and order conversion interact with the quote lifecycle.
- [x] Manually review the new files for completeness because the OpenSpec CLI is not available in this environment.
