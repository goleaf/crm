# Proposal: define-document-management

## Change ID
- `define-document-management`

## Summary
- Capture the SuiteCRM Documents module capabilities so the CRM mirrors the listed repository, organization, lifecycle, and collaboration behaviors.
- Clarify upload and storage, classification (types, categories, folders, tags), versioning with check-in/check-out, statuses and approvals, sharing/permissions, and discovery actions like search, preview, and download.

## Capabilities
- `document-repository`: Centralized document store with upload, metadata capture, statuses, types, and expiration handling.
- `document-organization`: Categorization through types, categories, folders, tags, templates, and relationships to other records.
- `document-collaboration`: Version control, check-in/check-out, approval workflows, sharing, permissions, and download/preview controls.
- `document-discovery`: Search across metadata and content, browse folders, and preview or download documents with permission enforcement.

## Notes
- The `openspec` CLI is unavailable in this environment; requirements are documented manually for later validation.
