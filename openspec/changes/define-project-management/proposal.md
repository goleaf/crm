# Proposal: define-project-management

## Change ID
- `define-project-management`

## Summary
- Outline core project management behaviors covering organization, metadata, team roles, and secure lifecycle operations.
- Specify real-time updates, prioritization views, and tagging so teams can manage projects responsively and find work fast.
- Define customization, access controls, and safe deletion/recovery to keep project data flexible yet protected.

## Capabilities
- `project-organization`: Project structure, metadata, tagging, sorting/prioritization views, and safe deletion/recovery.
- `project-teams-and-security`: Team/role assignments, manager ownership, and role-based access controls across project operations.
- `project-realtime-and-customization`: Real-time updates with smooth data handling plus admin-defined custom fields and layouts.

## Notes
- The `openspec` CLI is unavailable in this environment; requirements are documented manually.
