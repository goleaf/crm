- [x] Write the calendar requirements spec with ADDED requirements and scenarios for unified views, quick create, drag-and-drop rescheduling, color coding, filters/search, printing, sharing, and sync/export.
- [x] Capture design notes covering personal/shared/team calendars, permission enforcement, drag/drop and quick-create flows, and external sync/export (Google, Outlook, iCal).
