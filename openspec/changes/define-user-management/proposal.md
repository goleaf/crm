# Proposal: define-user-management

## Change ID
- `define-user-management`

## Summary
- Define user management capabilities covering account creation, profile data maintenance, and lifecycle controls so administrators can manage workspace access consistently.
- Capture requirements for user information updates, activation/deactivation with auditability, activity tracking for compliance, and user-owned preferences and profile customization to tailor the experience.

## Capabilities
- `user-lifecycle`: Create users, manage core profile data, and control activation/deactivation with audit history.
- `user-activity-logging`: Track and surface user activity including logins, profile changes, and status changes for administrators.
- `user-preferences-profiles`: Allow users to manage preferences (timezone, locale, notifications) and personalize their profile/appearance.

## Notes
- `openspec` CLI tooling is unavailable; specifications are drafted and reviewed manually.
