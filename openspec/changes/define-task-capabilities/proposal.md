# Proposal: define-task-capabilities

## Change ID
- `define-task-capabilities`

## Summary
- Define the Tasks module behavior across creation, assignment, prioritization, statuses, due dates, reminders, and delegation.
- Capture relationships such as parent tasks, dependencies, subtasks, checklists, comments, and time tracking.
- Specify recurrence, categorization, filtering/sorting, and how tasks connect to other records.

## Capabilities
- `task-capture-and-reminders`: Create and assign tasks with priority, status, due dates, reminders, and delegation.
- `task-structure-and-collaboration`: Manage relationships, subtasks, dependencies, checklists, comments, and time tracking.
- `task-recurring-and-discovery`: Configure recurring tasks, categories, and filter/sort capabilities for locating work.

## Notes
- OpenSpec CLI tooling is not available in this environment; manual validation of the spec files is required.
