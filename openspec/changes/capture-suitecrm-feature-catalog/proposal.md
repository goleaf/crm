# Proposal: capture-suitecrm-feature-catalog

## Change ID
- `capture-suitecrm-feature-catalog`

## Summary
- Record the SuiteCRM feature catalog as a reference baseline so we can map coverage, identify gaps, and plan parity work across modules.
- Group features by SuiteCRM categories (core CRM, sales/revenue, marketing, comms, projects, knowledge, workflow, analytics, admin, integrations, mobile/portal, data, UX, system, advanced) for reuse in analysis.
- Keep the catalog in OpenSpec format for consistency with other requirement changes.

## Capabilities
- `suitecrm-feature-baseline`: Preserve the published SuiteCRM feature list in a structured spec to support comparison and planning.

## Notes
- `openspec` CLI tooling is unavailable here; specifications are drafted and checked manually.
