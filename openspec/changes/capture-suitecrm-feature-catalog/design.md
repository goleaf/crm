# Design Notes

- Capture the existing SuiteCRM feature catalog verbatim, grouped by the same numbered categories, to retain fidelity for parity analysis.
- Each category is treated as a requirement in the OpenSpec format with at least one scenario that asserts the catalog entry is available for comparison.
- No functional system changes are introduced; this is a documentation baseline for future gap analysis and implementation planning.
- `openspec` validation tooling is not available in this environment; manual review ensures structure and scenarios are present.
