# Proposal: define-deal-management

## Change ID
- `define-deal-management`

## Summary
- Establish end-to-end deal (opportunity) management with pipeline views, customizable stages, and governance over movement between stages.
- Capture core value metrics (deal amount, currency, expected close date, probability) to drive weighted pipeline totals, forecasts, and close-date oversight.
- Define ownership, conversion to downstream orders, and close-out analytics (win/loss reasons, activity history) so revenue processes remain auditable.

## Capabilities
- `deal-pipeline-and-stages`: Configure stage sets and manage deals across pipeline/board views with reorderable, color-coded stages and controls for movement/aging.
- `deal-value-and-probability`: Track deal value, currency, expected close dates, and probability to compute weighted pipeline, forecast buckets, and cycle-time insights.
- `deal-ownership-and-conversion`: Assign owners/teams, convert deals to orders while preserving lineage, and capture win/loss outcomes with activity timelines.

## Notes
- OpenSpec CLI tooling is unavailable in this environment; specifications are drafted manually.
