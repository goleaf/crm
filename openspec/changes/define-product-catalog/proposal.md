# Proposal: define-product-catalog

## Change ID
- `define-product-catalog`

## Summary
- Establish the Products module foundations covering catalog records, classification, lifecycle states, pricing, inventory, bundling, and relationship modeling so products can be created, maintained, and sold consistently.

## Capabilities
- `product-catalog-data`: Master product records with categories/subcategories, type classification, manufacturer tracking, SKU/part numbers, statuses, lifecycle stage metadata, descriptions, images/attachments, and custom fields.
- `product-pricing-inventory`: Cost and list price storage, discount pricing rules, and inventory tracking that respect product status/lifecycle for availability.
- `product-relations`: Product bundles plus cross-sell and upsell relationships to drive recommendations and packaged offers.

## Notes
- The `openspec` CLI is not available in this environment; validation must be performed manually outside the workspace.
