# Tasks

- [x] Translate the SuiteCRM Contracts feature list into explicit requirements across data, lifecycle, and document/relationship handling; verify each bullet is represented.
- [x] Write `contract-data`, `contract-lifecycle`, and `contract-documents` specs with ADDED requirements and scenarios covering types, dates, values, statuses, terms, auto-renewals, notifications, approvals, SLAs, amendments, templates, and storage.
- [x] Capture design notes explaining how contract records interact with approvals, notifications, templates, and document storage across modules.
- [x] Manually review the new files for consistency because the OpenSpec CLI is not available in this environment.
