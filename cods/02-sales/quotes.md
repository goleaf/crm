# Quotes

Status: Partial

Summary:
- Added Quote domain models (quotes, line items, status history), enums, observer, and policies with tax/discount math, acceptance tokens, expiration, versioning pointer, and PDF-ready media support.
- Persistence via migrations covering quotes and supporting tables.
- Tenant scoping and morph map registration wired; UI surface and approval/automation flows still missing.
